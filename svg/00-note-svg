SVG Basics
==========

- The <svg> element is simply a DOM element, it behaves like a <div>
  element.
- Like a <div> element, it will take as much room as it possibly
  unless we specify the dimensions.

svg coordiante:
    (0,0) = top left corner
    x value move the coordinate right.
    y value move the coordinate down.

Styling svg element
===================

svg styling works just like html styling, you connect css with
class and id, or place style directly using the style attribute.
Dispite of the similarity, svg has its own set of styling properties.
Styling properties that work on html does not necessary work on svg.
Here is few example for the differences:

    html                      svg closet equivalent

    background-color    <>    fill
    border-color        <>    stroke
    border-width        <>    stroke-width

    transform           <>    no css equivalent, need to use transform attribute

    z-index             <>    does not apply, you have to remove and re-add
                              the element so that the order in which you add
                              your svg elements is the same as the
                              visual depth order that you want.

                              d3 selection come with helper method just
                              for this purpose:

                                 d3.selectAll('circles').sort(function(a, b){
                                     return a.zIndex - b.zIndex;
                                 });
